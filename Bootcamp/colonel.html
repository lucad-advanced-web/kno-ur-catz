		<p>Colonel Meow, born October 11th, 2011, was a Himalayan-Persian crossbreed cat best known for his unique fluffy coat and intense facial expressions. The cat rose to internet fame after being featured on the internet news site The Daily What in September 2012. He was adopted in 2011 by Anne Marie Avey of Seattle, Washington, after he was rescued by a local Himalayan and Persian Society. On August 9th, 2012, Avey set up a Facebook fan page for the cat, posting pictures and videos of Colonel Meow. By September 17th, 2012, the page had 166 likes. Later, on September 18th, 2012, three photos of the cat were featured on the Daily What with a link to his Facebook profile, followed by a similar post on the humor site Death and Taxes. Later that same day, Within 24 hours, the total count of likes for Colonel Meow’s Facebook page shot up from less than 200 to more than 9,400.
		In the following week, the photos of the fuzzy cat continued to make the rounds in the cat-friendly blogosphere and internet humor communities like The Daily Dot, Buzzfeed and Reddit. By the end of the last week in September, the Facebook page had accumulated 17,000 likes and The Daily What had featured a follow up interview with Anne Marie Avey, in which she noted that Colonel Meow was scheduled to appear on the American TV talk show Ellen in December. Since then, the Colonel has been featured in Seattle’s local news and radio stations like The Pacific Northwest Inlander, My Northwest and Northwest NPR-affiliate KPLU, as well as news blogs and foreign news sites, including the French news site Le Matin, British news site The Daily Mail, the Digital Journal, ABC News, the International Business Times, the Huffington Post and humor site Crave Online. On October 9th, Colonel Meow and Avery appeared on CNN’s Anderson Live. Colonel Meow has also been featured in The Guiness Book of World Records for "longest fur on a cat." His fur length averaged at 10 inches. Colonel Meow passed away in January 2014, but he will forever be in our hearts.</p></div><div class="video"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RYHcnpfkxqY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
