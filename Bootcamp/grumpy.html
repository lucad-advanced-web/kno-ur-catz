src="Grumpy.jpg"> <p>Grumpy Cat is a nickname given to an
angry-looking snowshoe cat that rose to fame online after its pictures
were posted to Reddit in late September 2012. The cat is also known as
“Tard” which is short for Tardar Sauce. Grumpy Cat is owned by Arizona
resident Tabatha Bundesen. The original photos of Grumpy Cat were posted
to the /r/pics subreddit by Bundesen’s brother Bryan on September 23rd,
2012. The Reddit post was instantly met with photoshopped parodies and
image macros from others, reaching the front page with more than 25,300
up votes in the first 24 hours. Meanwhile, the Imgur page gained nearly
1,030,000 views in the first 48 hours. The same day, three video clips
of the cat playing indoors were uploaded to YouTube by Bundesen the same
day. The newly christened “Grumpy Cat” was also featured on numerous
animal photo blogs and internet humor sites, including The Daily What,
Paw Nation, The Meta Picture, Eat Liver, UpRoxx, Daily of the Day and
FunnyJunk on September 25th. Some commenters even went onto draw
comparisons between Tard’s facial expression and other well-known
stern-looking fictional characters like Ron Swanson (Parks & Recreation)
and Dwight Schrute (The Office). In addition to its growing presence on
Reddit, Facebook and YouTube, more image macros and pictures of “Tard”
can be found on Tumblr under the tag #grumpy cat. In addition, Grumpy
Cat T-shirt merchandises are available for purchase on Clothes That
Kill. Bundesen also runs a Zazzle store that offers a wide range of
merchandises, including posters, mugs, mousepads, phone cases and
postage stamps. As of August 2013, Grumpy Cat merchandise is carried in
Urban Outfitters and Hot Topic stores, while online merchandising site
Entertainment Earth lists a number of upcoming products, including a
plush doll, a holiday ball ornament and a Kigurumi costume among many
others. On September 27th, Grumpycats.com was created as the official
homepage for Tard, blogging videos, images and news mentions of the cat.
On October 3rd, an official Twitter account, @GrumpyCatTard, was also
launched. As of August 2013, Grumpy Cat’s official Facebook fan page has
more than 1.1 million likes. </p></div><div class="video"><iframe
