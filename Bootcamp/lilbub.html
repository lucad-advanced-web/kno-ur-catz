state of Indiana, She is a female “perma-kitten” house cat born with
several genetic mutations causing dwarfism, polydactylism and disformed
lower jaw. The deformities are unfortunate, but it made her all the more
loveable. On November 8th, 2011, a video titled “good job bub.3gp” was
uploaded by YouTuber LilBubBub, featuring a video of the cat stalking
the camera before pouncing on it. The same day, the Lil Bub Tumblr blog
was launched, which highlighted the same YouTube video in the first
