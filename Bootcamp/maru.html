<div class="Catz"> <div class="cat-single">Maru <img
src="maru.jpg"> <p>Maru is a male Scottish Fold cat from Japan
who has become well-known in the YouTube community for the videos of him
playing in a childlike fashion, mostly lying around, jumping into small
cardboard boxes and sliding across his owner’s wooden floor. Maru in
Japanese means 'circle' or 'round.' He was born on May 24th, 2007.
His anonymous owner launched the photo blog “I am Maru” in November 2007
to curate photos of his cat. Maru’s official YouTube channel mugumogu
was created almost a year later in July 2008, showcasing Maru’s daily
adventures in short video format. As of May 2013, mugumogu’s channel has
more than 330,000 subscribers, 210 million views overall and averages
approximately 118,000 views per day. At one point, the channel was the
8th Most Subscribed channel and 11th Most Viewed YouTube channel of all
time in Japan. Maru’s YouTube channel was featured on Internet culture
blogs like BoingBoing, Neatorama and Urlesque. Later, Maru’s videos were
linked in numerous cat-related hubsites like I Can Has Cheezburger,
CuteOverload and Ebaum’s World. Maru’s videos also appeared on Sundance
Channel’s SUNfiltered blog and tech news blog Laughing Squid. Meanwhile
in Japan, Maru’s videos were featured in NHK’s variety program Exclusve!
Post Pictures and World News segment as the “world’s most famous cat,”
accruing between 800,000 and 3,600,000 views during the month of June
2009 alone. The news media coverage of Maru continued throughout 2010;
beginning when The Los Angeles Times’ Unleashed Blog published an
article titled “Your Morning Adorable YouTube Star: Maru the Cat”; In
June 2010, a video clip of Maru was showcased during an episode of the
Ellen Degeneres show; In July 2010, The New York Times mentioned Maru in
an article about the popularity of cats and dogs in the media titled “On
Films and TV, Cats and Dogs Playing Cute.”Entertainment Weekly has
listed the video channel in its “Notable Kitty Videos” article,
alongside Keyboard Cat and Nora the Piano Cat. In 2008 and 2009, Maru
won YouTube Japan’s video awards in the Pet / Animal category for two
consecutive years. In August 2010, Maru was voted the Internet’s
Favorite Feline in Urlesque’s “Catfight” event, beating the Ceiling Cat
in the final round. On September 1st, 2009, the first Maru photobook was
published in Japan. Over a year later in August 2010, a second book and
compilation DVD were released. Maru’s videos have been featured in more
than one commercial as well, including a web advertisement for the cat
food brand Fresh Step as well as other commercials for various products
sold in Japan.</p></div><div class="video"><iframe width="560"
