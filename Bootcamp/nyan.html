src="nyan.png"> <p>Nyan Cat, also known as Pop Tart Cat, is an
8-bit animation depicting a cat with the body of a cherry pop tart
flying through outer space. While absurd themes like flying kittens and
pastry cats have been around for some time, the surreal humor behind
this particular combination has captivated YouTubers and online art
communities, spawning fan illustrations as well as user-interface
designs and homebrew games across multiple platforms. The Pop Tart Cat
animation was posted on the daily comics site LOL-COMICS run by
illustrator Chris Torres, also known as prguitarman, on April 2nd, 2011.
The original drawing was based on his own Russian Blue cat, Marty, and
was drawn after receiving two separate suggestions for a cat and a pop
tart during a Red Cross charity drawing event on Livestream. Prior to
the Pop Tart Cat, prguitarman had already gained a relatively large
audience with a few other instances of comics circulating on the web.
The GIF animation was also reblogged via Tumblr on April 2nd, 2011,
accumulating over 3,000 notes (likes & reblogs) in its first two weeks.
On April 5th, 2011, YouTuber saraj00n posted a video titled Nyan Cat,
using comic artist prguitarman’s Pop Tart Cat animation set to the
well-known Japanese Vocaloid song Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya by Japanese
artist Daniwell-P looping in the background, Although the song had been
originally composed for Hatsune Miku to sing, The version used in the
video was of the cover sung by the Utauloid Momo Momone. The video
gained over one million views in its first two weeks. Many game
developers began to create assorted Nyan Cat games, such as Nyan Cat
Lost in Space, Snake Nyan Cat, Nyanicorn (Robot Unicorn Attack variant),
and Nyan Cat Fly, among others. A site listing all the Nyan Cat games
while also hosting one of its own is located at Nyan-Cat.com. Some Nyan
Cat games have also been released onto the mobile platform, enabling use
on various smartphones. A small tech demo of Nyan Cat that will work on
the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) has also been created,
It currently runs on NES emulators. Nyan cat has also been known for
making his own progress bar a depiction of himself. He still Nyan's to
this very day on websites like "Non-Stop nyan cat.com"</p></div><div
