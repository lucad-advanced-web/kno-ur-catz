<div class="Catz"> <div class="cat-single">Snoopy <img
src="snoopy.jpg"> <p>Snoopy is a male exotic shorthair cat based
in Chengdu, Sichuan, China known for his short snout and large brown
eyes. Snoopy was born on May 11th, 2011. Due to his pedigree, went on to
become a show cat and his owner launched a Weibo account to share
pictures of the cat in between shows. However, since Weibo is limited to
registered users, his owner also launched a blog and an Instagram
account for the cat in February 2012 as a way to share photos of Snoopy
with a larger audience. An interview with Snoopy’s owner was posted on
the Chinese blog APetGuide on February 10th, 2012, commenting on how
many fans the cat had gained on Weibo. In March 2012, a Thai Facebook
fan page for Snoopy launched, gaining more than 36,000 likes in a year.
Two months later, the cat broke on to the English-speaking web after a
featured post on Catsparella on April 11th, 2012. That month, two single
topic Tumblr blogs dedicated to the cat launched, Snoopy Kitty Purr and
Snoopy409. Photos of Snoopy have been shared on a variety of animal and
internet culture blogs including PBH2, Paw Nation, Complex, Cutest Paw,
Love Meow and Buzzfeed. Snoopy’s owner also uploads videos of Snoopy to
her personal YouKu account. Snoopy still lives in Chengdu with his owner
who frequently updates Snoopy's original Tumblr with many more adorable
photos. </p></div><div class="video"><iframe width="560" height="315"
