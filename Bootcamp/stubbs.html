src="Stubbs.jpg"> <p>Stubbs (born April 12, 1997) is a cat who has
been the honorary mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska, since July 1997. As of
2014, Stubbs is still mayor, and has been described as a tourist
attraction, having been flooded with cards and letters, and drawing 30
to 40 tourists each day (most of whom are en route to other Alaska
destinations, such as Mount McKinley) who hope to meet "the mayor".
Stubbs's position is honorary, as the town is only a "historical
district". He was found in 1997 by Lauri Stec, manager of Nagley's
General Store, in a box full of kittens in her parking lot. The owners
were giving the kittens away; Stec chose "Stubbs" because he did not
have a tail. A popular rumor states Stubbs was elected following a
successful write-in campaign by voters who opposed the human candidates.
However, according to NPR, the cat could not have been elected as a
write-in candidate because "the tiny town has no real mayor, so there
was no election."Nagley's General Store now doubles as Stubbs' Mayoral
Office. On August 31, 2013, Stubbs was attacked by a dog. Three days
later, Stubbs was reported to be recovering under heavy sedation at a
veterinary hospital, having suffered a punctured lung and fractured
sternum; the attacking dog had not been found. A crowdsourcing page was
set up to help pay for Stubbs' medical bills. Stubbs ended up staying in
the veterinary hospital for nine days before returning to the upstairs
room of the general store. Other exploits from which the feline mayor
has escaped include being shot by teenagers with BB guns, falling into a
restaurant's deep fryer (which was switched off and cool at the time),
and hitching a ride to the outskirts of Talkeetna on a garbage truck.
Every afternoon, Stubbs drinks water out of a wineglass laden with
catnip.</p></div><div class="video"><iframe width="560" height="315"
